This plugins extracts a dominant / average color of any image and stores it in the file's metadata as a HEX value.
Optionally, it can also generate a color palette from any image.

## 1. Installation

> Compatible with Kirby 5 (latest release) as well as Kirby 3 and 4 (maintained / tested up to v2.0.0 of this plugin).

Download and copy this repository to ```/site/plugins/colorextractor```

Alternatively, you can install it with composer: ```composer require sylvainjule/colorextractor```

<br/>

## 2. Usage

It can be used in two ways :

#### 2.1. Hooks

Once installed within the ```plugins``` folder, it will automatically start extracting colors for any image uploaded or replaced in the panel.

#### 2.2. Panel button

If you happen to upload files manually, from frontend or any other way while not trigerring the hooks, custom [janitor](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-janitor) jobs are also available to catch up with all the images of a website without an associated color.

You'll first need to install the janitor plugin and the Kirby CLI:

```bash
composer require getkirby/cli bnomei/kirby3-janitor
```

Then use the jobs in your blueprints:

```yaml
colorextractor:
    type: janitor
    label: Extract missing colors
    progress: 'Processing…'
    command: janitor:job --key sylvainjule.colorextractor.jobs.extractColors
```

The `extractColors` job will only extract the **missing colors**. If you want to force a re-extraction of existing colors, use the `forceExtractColors` job instead.

<br/>

## 3. Options

#### 3.1. Extraction mode

By default, the plugin tends to extract the most dominant / vibrant color of the image. Sometimes though, it can be handy to extract an average one based on an approximation of the whole color palette. When set to `average`, this options shrinks the image to a 1x1 pixel thumb, then grab the color the image processor chose as the average one. You'll find some examples [here](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby3-colorextractor/blob/master/docs/examples.md).

You can also set it to `both`, if you want both colors to be extracted and pick from them later from your templates (see the [`plugin's methods`](#42-if-both-colors-are-extracted))



Available options are `dominant | average | both`. Default is `dominant`.

```php
// config/config.php
return array(
  'sylvainjule.colorextractor.mode' => 'dominant',
);
```

#### 3.2. Transparency handling

The plugin needs to know how to handle colors with alpha value greater than zero, and what color to fallback to when transparency is detected.

Default is ```#ffffff```

```php
// config/config.php
return array(
  'sylvainjule.colorextractor.fallbackColor' => '#000000',
);
```

<br/>

## 4. Displaying and using the color

#### 4.1. If a single color is extracted

In case you have chosen either `dominant` (default) or `average` extraction mode, you can access it directly from your template under the `color` fieldname:

```php
$image->color();
```

The plugin works well combined with [@hananils's color picker](https://github.com/hananils/kirby-colors), which might come handy to preview and adjust the detected color.

```yaml
# Place this inside your file blueprint
fields:
  color:
    type: colors
```

#### 4.2. If both colors are extracted

If you have chosen to extract and store both colors, the color field will store both HEX values delimited by a comma. The plugin provides a file method to get a specific color from there:

```php
$image->color()->dominantColor();
$image->color()->averageColor();
```
